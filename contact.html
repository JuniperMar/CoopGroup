    <h2>Ms. Shannon</h2>
    <img class="shannon" src="images/shannon.jpg">
    <p>Ms. Shannon is MEA's Garden Educator!</p>
    <p>She is a former professional animal trainer-turned garden educator. After almost two decades in the animal theme
      park industry, she discovered her love for and connection to gardens...and guiding students through the “growing
      food and pollinator gardens” formula.</p>
    <p>She’s a former collegiate (Biology degree) soccer player with a love for anything outdoors, kids, animals, and
      gardens—not necessarily always in that order.</p>
    <p>She’s a mom to an active 10 year old boy, lives in the Clairemont community, and is beginning her 3rd year of
      teaching Sage Garden Project curriculum at two local elementary schools.</p>
    <p>She is also a National Geographic Certified Educator.</p>
    <p>If she isn’t working in the gardens, you’ll find her writing grants to support all the items needed to keep every
      garden healthy and vibrant, walking neighbor’s dogs with her son, or enjoying the amazing outdoor spaces around
      San Diego... and beyond.</p>
