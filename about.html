    <h1 class="orange">What is Coop Group?</h1>
    <hr class="line">
    <p>Coop Group is a club at MEA made up of a dedicated team of kids who help to clean the coop each week. Ms.
      Shannon, the garden teacher, leads us and generously shares her time to keep care of the chickens.

    <h1 class="orange">Our Routine</h1>
    <hr class="line">
    <p>We meet every week at the Coop outside the science labs and next to the Serenity Garden which we also help take
      care of. The chicken coop needs to be cleaned frequently so we are there every week. All chickens also like
      attention and company so Cleopatra appreciates it if you stop by and say hi! Every week, we refill her food and water.
      We also use rakes and and dust pans to spot-clean the ground, unless it's raining. Once a month, we change the
      shavings inside the coop so it is fresh. Lastly, we dump the waste we have collected into the dumpsters. When we
      are all done with the chores, we feed them treats and play with them. It's fun to spend time with them and fellow students!
