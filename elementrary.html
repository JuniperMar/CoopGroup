    <hr class="line">
    <p>This is currently not running at the moment. However, if you are an elementrary student and are interested in seeing Cleopatra, our hen, please contact Malia at <a href="mailto:maliawilke@gmail.com" class="contact-link">maliawilke@gmail.com</a>. She will reach out and arrange a time. You could also just find her on campus and she will most likely have time to let you into the coop.</p>
    
    <p>While Coop Group is only for secondary students. From 11:30-12:30 on Wednesdays we host open coop hour. Any
      elementrary student is free to come with their parent or gaurdian to spend time with the chickens. Our goal is to
      teach youger kids about chickens and animal care. Please note, that a student must be accompanied by their adult.
      We hope to see you there!
